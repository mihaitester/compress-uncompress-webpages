# Readme
Sometimes I download a lot of webpages for future reference in documentations, and it gets very cumbersome to store webpages if they are uncompressed.
Hence the idea would to write a small script which iterates folders recursively and if it finds `{pattern}.html` file and `{pattern}_files` folder, then the idea would be to create an archive containing these 2 items and then remove the existing file and folder once the archive is created.
